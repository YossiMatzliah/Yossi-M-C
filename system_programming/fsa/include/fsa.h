*	memory_segment - pointer to the start of a segment given by the user.
*		if memory_segment is not aligned, fsa would be start at aligned address.
*	segment_size - size in bytes of the given segment. 
*		if the size is 0, the behavior is undefined
*	block_size - minimun number of bytes for each block. if the size is 0, the behavior is undefined
*		Should be minimum WORD_SIZE, 
*
* @Returns:
*   pointer to the FSA handler.
*   if pointer to memory_segment is invalid, the behavior is undefined.

*	Time: O(n)
